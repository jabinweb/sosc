      "content": "Since 1947, India has been an independent democracy. In 2047, it will be a hundred years of independence. By 2030, we are expected to become the world's third largest economy. In the initial decades of independence, India used to take pride in the unity within our diversity. Today, the social fabric of our nation feels more vulnerable. The increasing polarisation, widening inequality, and such societal fault-lines are threatening our future. India is at this critical crossroad. A core conviction behind forming SoSC is this - what we collectively do in upcoming decades will determine who we become as a nation, and the answers we seek are not merely political, economic or technological. We need to return to the very roots of how social change occurs. School of Social Change is envisioned as a learning organisation to imagine afresh and model how social change can be effectively implemented. We want to promote more reflection and learning among professionals working in key service departments / sectors such as social work, education, philanthropy, health, etc. In a country with 3.3 million registered NGOs, thousands of organisations do the laudable work of implementing programs that improve the quality of life for different people-groups. However, these programs are unable to make a significant dent in the system, given the enormity of the challenges we face in India. School of Social Change is envisioned to function uniquely at the intersection between the implementation of programs and informing policy decisions. We don't just want to be an implementation organisation, or a policy organisation, but a hybrid of these two."

    "vision": "Typically, schools have an imposing metal door with a security guard stationed to ensure that all access is restricted. Imagine a world where metaphorically every school has an open door. A world where any child irrespective of whatever trauma they have undergone in their families or communities of origin, can walk into and through doors of learning & opportunity. Our vision encompasses: 1) Door of Opportunity - We envision a world where children across the education mortality spectrum find the right open door for them, addressing challenges of access, quality or relevance. 2) Formation of Identity - Education has a critical role beyond providing life opportunities for students. There is an aspect of nurturing the identity of students at formative developmental stages. 3) Character & Worldview - Education also has a role in shaping the character skills and the worldview of students; this is the way in which education becomes a vehicle of social change.",
